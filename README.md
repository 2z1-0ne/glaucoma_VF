## Archetype Analysis
This study is based on a hybrid artificial intelligence technique that combines archetypal analysis (AA) and fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering. The objective is to minimize the projection loss that occurs when visual field tests are analyzed solely using archetypal analysis. By doing so, the method aims to analyze and classify visual field tests without any loss of information.
